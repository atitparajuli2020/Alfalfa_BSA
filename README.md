# Cacao_Genomics
This repository contains all the necesasry scripts to reconstruct the data analysis from our work on the 200 Genomes in:

### Cornejo OE, Yee M-C, Adams A, Strandberg R, Livingston D, Stack C, Umaharan P, Royaert S, Tawari NR, Ng P, Gutierrez, O, Phillips W, Mockaitis K, Bustamante CD, Motamayor JC. Population genomic analyses of the chocolate tree, Theobroma cacao L., provide insights into the domestication process. (submitted Communications Biology). available in bioRXiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/223438

The Sections of this repository are separated by stage: 

    1. Raw reads processing, mapping and SNP identification
    
    2. SNP filtering for different analyses
    
    3. Population genetic analyses
    
      1. Genetic diversity analyses
      
      2. Population Structure
      
      3. Population demographics
      
      4. Identificaiton of Selective Sweeps associated to domestication
      
      5. Annotation of SNP impact on protein
      
      6. Cost of domestication analyses
